## 💎 Value Proposition: The Executive Defense Layer
E-VARA combines exposure monitoring, trust scoring, explainable risk analysis, and executive reporting into a single operating layer. The goal isn’t surveillance. The goal is helping users understand trust instead of collecting everything.
- **Exposure Intelligence**: Privacy-preserving ingestion that monitors exposure signals using cryptographic hashing at the edge, strictly minimizing storage of raw identifiers.
- **Explainable Risk**: Automated monitoring that surfaces risk and translates technical findings into understandable security decisions with a localized, dynamic risk score.
- **Executive Reporting & Protection**: Institutional-grade PDF dossiers ready for C-suite review, accompanied by stateless rate-limiting to prevent enumeration attacks.
- **Architectural Excellence**: Built with a production-oriented asynchronous edge worker architecture (React, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS).
- **Compliance Ready**: Designed with industry-standard cryptographic protections and SHA-256 client-side hashing protocols.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Advanced Identity Correlation Engine**: Maps identity markers across 5+ major social networks and the deep web.
- **Executive Threat Auditing**: Generates multi-page, professional-grade "Identity Dossiers" for executive security audits.
- **Validated Threat Intelligence Integration**: Real, configurable deep-web integrations with industry standards like HaveIBeenPwned (HIBP) and DeHashed via asynchronous Supabase Edge Workers.
- **Real-time Threat Visualization**: Interactive HUD-style dashboard with attack vector simulations.
- **SaaS Infrastructure**: Integrated multi-tier pricing, billing entry points, and robust user management.
